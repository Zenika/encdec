Encrypt and Decrypt strings<br><br>
___
(while technically different, I have a loose use of terms like encrypt-encode; I'm not pedantic and aware that they are different; bear with me, please :-) )
<H2>Overview</H2>
<H3>How does it work</H3>
In its default mode, this tool will encrypt and decrypt any string you will pass as an argument.<br>
With the `-f` parameter, you pass a source and destination filename, and it will AES-256 encode/decode the file.
<H3>String mode</H3>
Simple: `encdec {encode|decode} $STRING`<br>
Where $STRING is the string to encode or decode. Note that the decoded string will be output to stdout.

<H3>File mode (requires the -f flag)</H3>
You need to provide the full source pathname and full destination pathname. It'll encode the source file and output it to destination pathname.

<H3>Private key</H3>
AES-256 needs a private key to encrypt and decrypt a file or string. There is a built-in key in the software that you can easily find browsing the source code. I left it there while developing the software and before of thinking publishing that code.<br>
If you want to use your own, the `-k` flag will prompt you eventually to provide your own key. You will need to safe-keep it somewhere, as there are no mechanisms to retreive if lost. Also, note that the key _needs to be exactly 32bytes long_.

<H2>Build, Install</H2>
You can either build from source, or use the provided binary packages (Alpine, RedHat, Debian)

<H3>Source install</H3>
Once you've cloned the repo, go into the `src/` directory, and run `./upgrade_pkgs.sh` (about this, please note that package upgrades have not been tested beyond current versions, for obvious reasons).

After this step, you can run `./build.sh` (providing an optional `-o` param with a target dir is available). This will build and copy the binary into `/opt/bin`

You might wish to `strip` the produced binary, as it still contains debugging code.

<H3>Binary packages</H3>
For now, I provide all the necessary scripts and files to build the RPM, DEB and APK packages, but all of these depend on my own build containers, which, for now, I do not provide. Maybe some other time, but not now as they depend way too heavily on my home architecture.

So, as an alternative, you can find the binary packages at
